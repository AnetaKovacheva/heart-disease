# heart-disease

This Notebook explores and models the Personal Key Indicators of Hearth Disease dataset. 
My goal is to explore, analyse and visualize the data, and to build and train a Machine Learning model capable to predict if a person is prone to heart disease, or not. 
The main focus is to tune the model and to explain how features (i.e., health condition and habits) affect heart health.
